			<Row style={{'text-align':'justify'}}><p>Just before all the chaos that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the world, in January 2020 I had the opportunity and the privilege to lead a summer course of basic electronics lab II class. The experience was complete: I had to elaborate the activity scripts, teach the theoretical classes and monitor the students practical development. The circuit in question that the students had to develop was an ECG signal generator, as well as a circuit for its processing. The complete circuit is shown in the image below.</p>
			<Col className="justify-content-center"><Figure><Figure.Image src={String(circuito_completo)} /></Figure></Col>

				<li>DAC 8 bits;</li>
				<li>Inverter adder;</li>
				<li>Instrumentation amplifier;</li>

			<p>The circuit that I will show below is one of the products of my masters dissertation. In it I am using a microcontroller NRF51822 for the sensing of a hydrometer and communication of telemetry data via Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE).</p>
			<p>The circuit had to sample voltage signals acquired through an optical sensor, using a low-power comparator. The telemetry data was saved in an EEPROM memory, via the I2C interface, and also sent via BLE.</p>
			<p>The biggest challenge of the project was to develop this entire circuit using the harvest of solar energy as an energy source. An energy management circuit had to be developed, which was able to capture energy and store it in a supercapacitor, as well as firmware programming routines and practices were adapted to lower energy consumption.</p>

			<p>It was necessary to develop a low consumption datalogger circuit to perform some measurements on my IoT telemetry device in an external environment, developed during the masters degree.</p>
			<p>The same microcontroller as the telemetry device, NRF51822, was used to sample voltage levels and store them in flash memory using the SPI interface. For this purpose, an analog conditioning circuit was developed, with operational amplifiers, to limit the bandwidth of the sampled voltage signal.</p>

			<p>I came to visit the laboratory with my space-modeling that I was a part of at Unicamp. Our team signed up for the Cubesats (mini satellites) development competition at INPE. In this project, I was responsible for the development of Cubesats orientation algorithm, using solar panels. We used STM32F103 microcontrollers to process the data on the device, which I had to develop part of the logic and firmware. The image below shows the ready Cubsat.</p>

			<p>My final undergraduate work in electronic engineering was the development of an electrocardiograph circuit capable of capturing 3 ECG leads.</p>

I also had to develop the firmware for the Atmega328 microcontroller, which communicated via the UART interface with a computer. In turn, the graphical interface, that I programmed in C++ using the Qt library, received the data and showed it on the computer monitor.</p>
