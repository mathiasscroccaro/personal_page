		"Just before all the chaos that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the world, in January 2020 I had the opportunity and the privilege to lead a summer course of basic electronics lab II class. The experience was complete: I had to elaborate the activity scripts, teach the theoretical classes and monitor the students' practical development. The circuit in question that the students had to develop was an ECG signal generator, as well as a circuit for its processing. The complete circuit is shown in the figure below."
